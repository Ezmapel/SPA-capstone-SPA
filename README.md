This is a Single Page Application I built as a practice project to develop my coding skills. I have been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript since January of 2020, and have utilized those three languages to create this scheduling application. It essentially serves as a doctor/patient portal, allowing for a doctor to login to the “Doctor Portal” and create a schedule of availability. A patient can then log-in on the “Patient Portal” side to book an appointment with a listed doctor.
